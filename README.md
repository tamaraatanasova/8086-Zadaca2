# 8086-Zadaca2

For the microprocessor system implemented in the previous task, write a routine that will detect when it is
pressed key on the matrix keyboard, then decodes the value corresponding to that key
(hexadecimal digit) and shows the value on the seven-segment display. In case of error, the
the display should show the character H. The output port address of the seven-segment display is 90h,
keyboard output port is 80h and keyboard input port is 81h.

**Subject**

Microcomputer's systems

**Built With**

This project is built using the following tools:

- [Emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/): Assembler and emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

**Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run this project you need:

A working computer
Connection to internet
Setup

**How to Run**

To run the program, you need an 8086 emulator or assembler. You can use emulators like DOSBox or TASM (Turbo Assembler). Here's how to run the program using EMU8086:

1. Download and install Emu8086 from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open Emu8086 and load the `palindrome.asm` file.
4. Assemble the code by pressing the Assemble button.
5. Run the program by pressing the Run button or by pressing F10.
